# 🚀 Test Template - Unlimited Photos Support

## 📝 Updated Appendix Template (No Image Module):

Replace your current appendix with this version that supports unlimited photos:

```
APPENDIX A
Photographs

{{#hasPhotographs}}
This report includes {{photographCount}} photographs taken during the site inspection.

Photo List:
{{appendix_photos_list}}

{{#photographs}}
{{image}}
Caption: {{caption}}
Filename: {{filename}}

{{/photographs}}
{{/hasPhotographs}}

{{^hasPhotographs}}
No photographs were included with this report.
{{/hasPhotographs}}
```

## 🔄 Key Changes:

1. **`{{image}}` instead of `{{%image}}`** - Using regular placeholder instead of image module syntax
2. **Unlimited Loop Support** - The `{{#photographs}}` loop will iterate through ALL uploaded photos
3. **Text Placeholders** - Images show as `[IMAGE: filename.jpg]` for now while we debug

## 🎯 What This Tests:

- ✅ Loop structure works with unlimited photos
- ✅ Template data structure is correct
- ✅ Basic rendering without image module interference
- 🔄 Once this works, we'll add proper image embedding back

## 📊 Data Structure:

The system now provides:
```javascript
{
  photographs: [
    {
      image: "[IMAGE: photo1.jpg]",  // Will be actual image buffer later
      caption: "Description or filename",
      filename: "photo1.jpg",
      originalUrl: "s3://..."
    },
    // ... unlimited photos
  ],
  hasPhotographs: true,
  photographCount: 3
}
```

## ⚡ Test Instructions:

1. Update your template appendix with the code above
2. Upload multiple photos (try 5-10 photos)
3. Generate Word document
4. Verify the loop creates entries for ALL photos

Once this basic loop works, I'll implement proper image embedding that supports unlimited photos.
