🔧 1. Performance Benchmarks
📌 What It Is:
Quantitative metrics about how your app performs under normal or high-load usage. This boosts credibility and helps guide future optimization.

📊 Key Metrics to Collect:
Area	Metric	Tools
Document Generation	Avg/95th percentile generation time (in sec)	Manual logs, backend timing, SSE progress
Image Uploads	Avg upload size & time	S3 SDK, front-end timestamps
Auto-Save	Response latency for PATCH step updates	Express logs, browser DevTools
DB Queries	Latency for GET report, steps, images	Mongoose .explain(), MongoDB Atlas Profiler
Frontend	First load time, TTI (Time to Interactive)	Lighthouse, Web Vitals

✅ How to Start:
Add timing logs to key backend routes (e.g., /generate-doc, /steps/:id)

Use performance monitoring (e.g., MongoDB Atlas Performance Advisor or New Relic for backend)

Capture user-facing latency with Custom Metrics Dashboard or tools like LogRocket

🧪 2. Testing Strategy
📌 Why It Matters:
Testing ensures you don’t break core functionality as you scale, especially with auto-save, document gen, and authentication.

🧰 Recommended Stack:
Test Type	Purpose	Tools
Unit Tests	Test business logic (e.g., text enhancement, validation)	Jest, Vitest
Integration Tests	Test end-to-end backend flow (e.g., upload → S3 → DB write)	Supertest, Jest
E2E / UI Tests	Simulate user filling form, uploading image, generating report	Cypress, Playwright

✅ How to Start:
Begin with unit tests for utilities (lib/), zod validation, AI enhancement

Use Supertest to test Express endpoints like PATCH /steps/:step or POST /generate-doc

Gradually add Cypress to test the 6-step flow and image uploads

🔁 3. CI/CD Pipeline
📌 What It Is:
Automated process that builds, tests, and deploys your app when you push to Git.

🔧 Tools You Could Use:
Tool	Purpose
GitHub Actions	Linting, build, testing, deploy
Vercel / Netlify	Deploy frontend with previews
Render / Railway / AWS	Deploy backend API
Docker (Optional)	Containerize Express for consistent environments

✅ Starter GitHub Actions Workflow:
yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Build & Deploy

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run check
      - run: npm run test
👥 4. User Roles / Permissions
📌 Why:
Adds multi-user control for firms or teams, helpful for scaling beyond solo engineers.

🔐 Example Roles:
Admin: Full access, user invites, billing (future)

Editor: Can fill out and submit reports

Viewer: Can only read/download completed reports

🗃️ Schema Suggestion:
ts
Copy
Edit
// User model
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  email: string,
  role: 'admin' | 'editor' | 'viewer',
  firmId?: ObjectId
}
✅ How to Start:
Add a role field to Users collection

Add middleware like requireRole('editor') for protected routes

Eventually allow multiple users under a firmId

🛡️ 5. Legal & Compliance
📌 Why It Matters:
If these reports are used in insurance claims or legal disputes, your app becomes part of an evidentiary chain. That means liability.

Key Concerns & Suggestions:
Concern	What To Do
Data Retention	Define how long you keep reports. Let users delete/export their data.
Access Logs	Track when users access, download, or modify reports
Backups	Regular backups of MongoDB and S3 assets
Terms & Conditions	Add EULA and privacy policy explaining data use
PII Handling	Avoid storing unnecessary personal data; encrypt what you do store
Audit Trail (optional)	Maintain ActivityLogs collection per user/report action

🧭 What You Should Do Next (Action Plan)
Phase 1: Core Data Reliability
✅ Save final generated documents in S3
✅ Add version history per report in Mongo
✅ Add download access per version

Phase 2: Developer Experience & Quality
🔲 Add unit/integration tests with Jest & Supertest
🔲 Set up GitHub Actions for CI (build/lint/test)
🔲 Begin using ESLint & Prettier strictly

Phase 3: UX & User Management
🔲 Add user roles: Admin / Editor / Viewer
🔲 (Optional) Add firm-level grouping for shared access

Phase 4: Compliance Readiness
🔲 Add logs of key user actions (report created, generated, downloaded)
🔲 Write data retention & privacy statement
🔲 Backup plan for S3 & MongoDB (daily/weekly snapshots)
