# üìù Updated Appendix Template - Working Version

## üéØ Replace Your Current Appendix With This:

```
APPENDIX A
Photographs

{{#hasPhotographs}}
This report includes {{photographCount}} photographs taken during the site inspection.

Photo List:
{{appendix_photos_list}}

{{#photographs}}
{{%photo_buffer_{{index}}}}
Caption: {{caption}}
Filename: {{filename}}

{{/photographs}}
{{/hasPhotographs}}

{{^hasPhotographs}}
No photographs were included with this report.
{{/hasPhotographs}}
```

## üîß Alternative Simpler Version (Recommended):

If the above doesn't work, use this simpler approach:

```
APPENDIX A
Photographs

{{#hasPhotographs}}
This report includes {{photographCount}} photographs taken during the site inspection.

Photo List:
{{appendix_photos_list}}

Photo 1:
{{%photo_buffer_1}}
Caption: {{photo_caption_1}}
Filename: {{photo_filename_1}}

Photo 2:
{{%photo_buffer_2}}
Caption: {{photo_caption_2}}
Filename: {{photo_filename_2}}

Photo 3:
{{%photo_buffer_3}}
Caption: {{photo_caption_3}}
Filename: {{photo_filename_3}}

{{/hasPhotographs}}

{{^hasPhotographs}}
No photographs were included with this report.
{{/hasPhotographs}}
```

## üîç What Changed:

1. **Individual Image Buffers**: Each image now has its own placeholder (`photo_buffer_1`, `photo_buffer_2`, etc.)
2. **Separate Caption/Filename**: Text data is separate from image data
3. **Simple References**: The image module can directly access each buffer

## üß© Why This Works:

The `docxtemplater-image-module-free` has issues with complex loop structures containing image data. By creating individual placeholders, we work around this limitation while still providing automatic image embedding.

## üöÄ Test Instructions:

1. Update your template with the simpler version above
2. Generate a Word document 
3. Images should now embed correctly

The system will automatically create placeholders for up to 20 images (`photo_buffer_1` through `photo_buffer_20`).
